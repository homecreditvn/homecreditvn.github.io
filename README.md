## Install

```bash
npm install --save homecredit-ui
```

## Usage

You can import the whole component library, or use named imports:

```js
import * as Components from 'homecredit-ui'
// use Components.Button, etc.
import { Button } from 'homecredit-ui'
// use Button
```

You can also import from individual files, which helps with tree-shaking:

```js
import Button from 'homecredit-ui/lib/button'
// use Button
```

And import stylesheets manually:

```css
import 'homecredit-ui/dist/index.css';
```

For component documentation, see the [docs site](https://homecreditvn.github.io/).
